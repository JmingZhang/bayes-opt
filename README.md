# bayes-opt

This repository contains implementations of SPGP (Snelson and Ghahramani) and Online Sparse GPs (Lehel Csato), translated to python from the original work of the respective authors.

Also included is a simple implementation of Bayesian optimization, as well as a demonstration in example_script and a script that tests weighted and unweighted online GPs on LCLS data.

The LCLS data is too large to include in the repository, so for now only a subset taken at a particular electron energy is included.
